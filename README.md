## 🚀 The Innovation: "Stabilized IoT"
Most smart restrooms fail in real-world environments due to **Sensor Noise** and **Alert Spam**. **SmartSan+** implements industrial software stabilization techniques (Moving Averages and State Confirmation) to ensure every alert is verified and actionable.

### **Key Performance Features**
* **Anti-Flicker Occupancy:** Uses a 3-cycle confirmation buffer for the VL53L0X Laser sensor.
* **Odor Moving Average:** MQ-135 readings are filtered through a 5-sample window to ignore momentary spikes.
* **One-Shot Alerts:** Active buzzer logic includes a 5-second "Alert Cooldown" to prevent repetitive noise.
* **Resource Accountability:** IR-based stock monitoring with 3s delay confirmation.

## 🧠 System Logic (State Machine)

| Feature | Sensor | Stabilization Strategy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Occupancy** | VL53L0X | **Confidence Counter:** Must maintain <800mm for 3 cycles to trigger "Occupied." |
| **Air Quality** | MQ-135 | **Moving Average:** Filters noise from the heater element for a stable PPM baseline. |
| **Restock** | IR Sensor | **Hysteresis Logic:** Alerts only after 3 continuous seconds of empty-state detection. |
| **SOS Alert** | Push Button | **Hardware Interrupt:** Immediate response with software-level debounce protection. |

## 💻 Installation

### 1. Hardware Calibration
> [!WARNING]
> The **MQ-135** requires a 10-15 minute pre-heat period before readings become stable. Do not calibrate thresholds during the first 5 minutes of power-on.

### 2. Software Deployment
1. Install the `micropython-vl53l0x` library via Thonny.
2. Configure your `BLYNK_AUTH_TOKEN` in the code.
3. Upload `main.py` to the ESP32.

```python
# To test library installation
from vl53l0x import VL53L0X
print("SmartSan+ Stabilized Driver: Ready")
